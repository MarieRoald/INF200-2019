# Welcome to the module pages for INF200 at NMBU.

## Welcome
This is a hands-on course that will take you from beginner to seasoned Python
programmer in one semester. Therefore, this is a fast-paced module and we
expect you to work on weekly coursework in order to take the exam.

The contents of the course will be posted on this page, which you are expected
to check weekly. 

## Course content
After taking INF120, you know of most of the programming concepts needed to
develop advanced code. The contents of INF120 is, in fact, enough to solve
most programming problems you can concieve of. However, you do not have
experience programming. You can consider yourself as a carpenter who's seen
all tools needed for his craft, but never put them to good use. This module
will teach you how to put your tools to good use.

When developing software, we spend most of our time reading code. In fact,
most developers working full time on large programming project produce
between [10 and 40 new lines](https://successfulsoftware.net/2017/02/10/how-much-code-can-a-coder-code/)
of code per day. That is between one and five lines of code per hour. What
is the rest of the time spent doing? Reading code and figuring out how to
best tackle a specific problem. In light of this, it is clear that we must
write code that is easily understood by our coworkers (and ourselves). Doing
this is no small feat, and that will be the focus of this module.

Additionally, writing code is seldomly done alone. We colaborate with colleagues
on work projects, with friends on personal projects, and if you develop Open
Source Software, we might communicate with strangers on the internet. When we
work this way, we must be certain that the code we are writing now won't induce
new bugs in the code our colleagues write. To accomplish this, we must use 
something called *unit tests*, that will automatically test if our code is doing
what we think it should be doing. If we see that our code suddenly stops
working, then we must be able to track the changes and see where and when the
bug came in place. To accomplish this, we use a version control system (often
called VCS). The VCS we use in this course is called Git, and is possibly the
most popular VCS right now.

We will also learn different paradigms as to how to approach programming
problems. The main focus will be on object oriented programming (OOP), which
is one of the most widely used programming paradigms. In OOP, we create
interfaces that solve problems, but hide the details as to how the problem is
solved. For example, if we want to write a human resources (HR) system that
tracks the name, salary and position of employees, then we provide an interface
to add new employees, change their salary and obtain information about them. 
However, how the salary is computed and the information is stored is not
readily available for the user.

There are other facets that we will consider as well and how much in depth
we go depends on the pace of the lectures. We will discuss numerical and
scientific programming in Python, how to write efficient Python code and
the key concepts of functional programming.

Finally, this course does not have a traditional exam. Instead, you are expected
to work in pairs on a three-week full-time programming assignment, either in
January or in June. More information about this task will be released later.
