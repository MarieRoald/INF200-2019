I have now looked at the class attendance list and grouped you into tutorial groups. You may attend other tutorials
than that you are assigned to so long as you are respectful to those who are assigned to that tutorial and leave
if it gets full.

**Group 1:** (Wednesdays 10-12)
 * You should set Ngoc as the reviewer for the pull requests
 * Everyone with a surname starting on AAA-GRA

**Group 2:** (Thursdays 12-14)
 * You should set Ahmed as the reviewer for the pull requests
 * Everyone with a surname starting on GRB-KLE

**Group 3:** (Fridays 08-10)
 * You should set Daniel as the reviewer for the pull requests
 * Everyone with a surname starting on KLF-NAA

**Group 4:** (Fridays 10-12)
 * You should set Ngoc as the reviewer for the pull requests
 * Everyone with a surname starting with letters NAB or later
