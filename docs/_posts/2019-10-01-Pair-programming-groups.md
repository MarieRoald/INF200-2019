title: "Pair programming groups"
---

It is now time for the first pair programming assignment. I hope most of you have managed to find a partner by now,
otherwise, you should visit [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0FZT-hhvWnmIQy7vTXWhhWlhFB8gptJOdnEEP5G-IJnbY8A/viewform)
link and request a partner. I will allocate partners tomorrow.

When you find your partner, make sure that they can attend the same block(s) as you for the final project (January 
or June). Also, try to find a partner within your TA group. If you have strong preferences to work with
someone outside your tutorial group, then it is fine, but you are giving us some headache admin-wise.

Once you find your partner, please register (once per group) on 
[this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeH5mSNVzAJ84RNHM2D2Dk5IA0jsnVZZ6igkZQ7sK9GmHUeQ/viewform).
You should not do this if we allocate a partner to you.

I will post some YouTube videos this week so stay posted for those.
