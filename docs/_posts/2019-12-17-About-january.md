Happy holidays everybody!

Some of you have asked when you are supposed to come in January. We will start with a 
lecture at 9:15 the 6th of January. Afterwards, you should work on your project at the university.

We will have two TAs there to help you all from 9 to 15 every day.

Attendance is mandatory, and we will pass around a list for you to sign.

Good luck with any exams you may have left!
