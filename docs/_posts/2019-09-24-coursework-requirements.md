All coursework must follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to be accepted. To enable PEP-8 checking in Python,
see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyINGuxFpnU) YouTube video. If your code does not show a green checkmark in PyCharm,
then the TAs are instructed to reject the coursework.

Also, the deadline for the coursework is Friday, the following week at 14:00. To submit the coursework, create a pull request,
requesting to merge the given exercise branch into the master branch. The TAs will grade your work as soon as possible,
and you can expect your results a week (give or take) after submitting the coursework.

If you have any trouble handing in, then send an e-mail to the TA explaining your situation *before* the deadline.
