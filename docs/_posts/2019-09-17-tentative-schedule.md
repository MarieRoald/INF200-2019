title: "Tentative course schedule"
---

Some of you have requested more information about the course schedule.
It is, unfortunately, somewhat difficult for me to give a detailed
schedule as I am in the process of modernising part of the content.
However, I have created a tentative outline that is up to change at a 
moments notice. 

Also, it is unfortunately impossible for me to give any information as
to when I will release new YouTube videos, since they can take a long 
time to make (approx 4-10 times the watch time), even with no editing.
I will let you know, either in lecture, or by e-mail, whenever I post 
or link to a video that is a part of the course contents.

Now, about the coursework. I will release coursework during or shortly 
after each lecture, and the deadline is always on the Friday the week 
after 14:00. The same rule applies for project assignments, except that 
you have two weeks to solve them.

**Here is the tentative outline for the module.**
