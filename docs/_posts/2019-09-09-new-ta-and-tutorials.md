We also have a new tutorial session at Thursdays between 12 and 14. This means that we have the following schedule
 
 * **Mondays 14-16:** Lecture
 * **Wednesdays 10-12:** Tutorial
 * **Thursdays 12-14:** Tutorial
 * **Fridays 08-10:** Tutorial
 * **Fridays 10-12:** Tutorial

You will be allocated to a tutorial group shortly. You can attend other tutorial groups if there are space, but
if they are full, then we kindly ask you to let those assigned to that group get priority.
