# How to submit your exam
There is a YouTube video showing the process [here](https://youtu.be/9vJVNJ17eOo)

3. Push that tag to origin

# Biosim map example
I have uploaded example code to create a static plot of a map. It is located [here](Project/mapplot/mapplot.py).

# Biosim cookiecutter template
The cookiecutter template you should use is [here](https://github.com/yngvem/biosim_template).
To use it, open your terminal window (Anaconda Prompt on Windows) and navigate to the directory
you want to have the project in. Then, type the following lines in the terminal

```
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter gh:yngvem/biosim_template
```

Then, rename the project folder to `BioSim_G00_Daniel_Ngoc`, replacing the group number and first names
accordingly. Use two digits for the group number.
