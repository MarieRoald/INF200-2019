    "When we program, we make mistakes. These mistakes can be devastating in real-world applications. For example, patients might be given a lethal dose of ionising radiation during radiotherapy, as was the case with the [Therac-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25) scandal. In this scandal, a concurrent programming error led to patients given too high dose, an error that could be avoided if they had tested that the code gave the same results with different number of threads.\n",

    " * Regression tests\n",
    "   - Tests for bugs that are discovered during or after the development process.\n",
    "   - These are kept around after the bugs are fixed to ensure that the bugs don't return (regress) if we change the code later.\n",

    " - Your tests should not fail if the code works.\n",
    " - The fact that all tests are passing is *not* a guarantee for everything to be correct.\n",
    " - It is always better to have some ok tests not to have the perfect test\n",

    "## Test driven development (TDD)\n",
    "Test driven development is a particular framework for writing code. The idea is to write the tests first, and then write the code. There are several reasons for why this is a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, if you write the code first, then you will never write the tests, or if you do, they will probably not be very good. However, to write the tests, you need to know how the code should work. Thus, writing tests first ensures two things, firstly, that you get unit tests, and secondly, that you plan your code before you start programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these advantages give clear benefits to writing the code first. Moreover, if you write the tests first, then you might realise that the problem is more difficult than you first thought and you might realise that there are more requirements to the problem than you first thought. I therefore very much reccomend writing code following TDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agile software development\n",
    "Agile software development is a \"modern\" (from 2001) style of software development, in which the focus is on writing code that works fast and then updating it consistently. For Agile to work, we need a strong focus on testing, which is why TDD is a part of Agile software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous integration (CI)\n",
    "Continuous integration is a tool where the tests are run whenever we either push code to a remote repository or when we submit a pull request. See, for example, [this](https://github.com/yngvem/group-lasso) project. Whenever I push code to this project, the CI system that I use, [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/), will run all the unit tests automatically for me, ensuring that the code works on other computers than my own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test coverage\n",
    "A metric to look at when we are testing code is the test coverage, which is the percentage of code lines that are being tested by the test suite. Similar to TravisCI, there are tools that will automatically test how many percentages of your code lines that were tested. One such tool is [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/), which you can also see in [this](https://github.com/yngvem/group-lasso) project."
