# Information about the exam

The exam will last approximately 20 minutes, up to 25 minutes. The first five minutes of the exam will be an oral presentation before a 10-20 minutes long discussion about your code. 

## Your presentation should contain the following:

- A diagram that displays the structure of your classes (instructions on this will be added shortly)
- Brief argument for why your code is trustworthy (showcase test coverage, statistical tests, etc.)
- A showcase of any extra features you added to the simulation
- A figure demonstrating the visualisation toolkit from your simulation

Note that the presentation should last for five minutes. We will stop you after seven minutes (but this does not mean that your presentation should last this long) so please keep tabs on the time during the presentation.



## Submitting the presentation:

To ensure that the exam goes according to the schedule, all presentation files will be available on a laptop in the exam room. Therefore, you need to upload the exam material on the project GitHub repository. Ensure that you have done the following tasks

* Create a folder in the base folder of your project repository with the name *Exam*
* In the Exam folder, add the presentation as a single PDF file
* Add a video file (mp4, avi or gif) showing the simulation visualisation to the Exam folder
* Commit these files
* Add the tag *exam_materials* to a commit that contain those files
* Push the tag to GitHub

The deadline is **Saturday 25th of January 12:00, (noon)**. That is, the middle of the day, not at midnight.



I will contact you using your student e-mail or Canvas if I have any trouble with your material so please check that daily until Monday.



## On the exam day

The exam schedule will be posted on Friday, 24th of January. 

You should wait outside the exam room 15 minutes before your allocated time slot. We are running a tight schedule, (28 groups in two days) so we cannot reschedule if you are late.

The first exam each day will start at 9:00 AM and the last exam will start at 4:30 PM.
